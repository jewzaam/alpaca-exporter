# Test Plan: General Device Behavior

## Purpose

Validate device behavior that is common to both auto-discovery and manual configuration modes.

## Scope

These tests apply regardless of how devices are discovered or specified. The behavior is the same whether using `--discover` or `--device_type N`.

---

## Behavior Tests

### Device Stays Connected

**Given:** Device online for multiple cycles  
**Expected:**
- No state transition logs
- Metrics update every cycle
- Success counter increments each cycle
- Error counter is not incremented

---

### Connected Device Disconnects

**Given:** Device connected, then goes offline  
**Expected:**
- Log: `DISCONNECTED: device/0 not responding`
- Metric: `alpaca_device_connected=0`
- Metric created: `alpaca_error_total`, `alpaca_error_created`
- Error counter incremented for failed name query
- Other metrics keep last value (i.e. `alpaca_device_name`)

---

### Disconnected Device Reconnects

**Given:** Device was connected, disconnected, then connects again  
**Expected:**
- Log: `CONNECTED: device/0`
- Metric: `alpaca_device_connected=1`
- Success counter resumes incrementing
- All device metrics resume updating
- `alpaca_success_created` does not change (metric already exists)
- `alpaca_error_total` no longer incrementing
- `alpaca_error_created` does not change

---

### Not-Implemented Attribute (Error 1024)

**Given:** Telescope connected, query for `declinationrate` returns ErrorNumber 1024 (driver doesn't support tracking rates)
**Expected:**
- No error counter incremented
- Attribute added to skip list: `skip_device_attribute["telescope"]["0"] = ["declinationrate"]`
- Next cycle: `declinationrate` not queried (returns `None` immediately)
- Other attributes (altitude, azimuth, declination, etc.) continue to be queried normally

---

### Skip List Reset on Connect

**Given:** Telescope connects with Driver A, then disconnects and reconnects with Driver B (different driver with different capabilities)
**Expected:**
1. Telescope connects with Driver A
2. Log: `CONNECTED: telescope/0`
3. Skip list reset to empty
4. Query `declinationrate` â†’ returns ErrorNumber 1024 (not implemented in Driver A)
5. Attribute added to skip list: `skip_device_attribute["telescope"]["0"] = ["declinationrate"]`
6. Next cycle: `declinationrate` not queried (returns `None` immediately)
7. Telescope disconnects
8. Log: `DISCONNECTED: telescope/0 not responding`
9. Telescope reconnects with Driver B
10. Log: `CONNECTED: telescope/0`
11. Skip list reset to empty for telescope/0
12. Next cycle: `declinationrate` queried (not skipped anymore)
13. Query returns valid value: `0.0` (implemented in Driver B)
14. Success counter incremented for `declinationrate` attribute
15. Metric created: `alpaca_telescope_declination_rate{...}=0.0`

---

### Multiple Devices with Independent State Transitions

**Purpose:** Verify that device state transitions are independent and don't interfere with each other.

**Given:** Three connected devices, then:
1. Rotator/0 stays connected throughout
2. Telescope/0 disconnects
3. Camera/0 disconnects
4. Telescope/0 reconnects

**Expected:**

**Initial State (all connected):**
- All three devices: `CONNECTED` logged, metrics created
- `alpaca_device_connected=1` for all three
- All three updating metrics normally

**Cycle 2: Telescope disconnects**
- Log: `DISCONNECTED: telescope/0 not responding`
- Metric: `alpaca_device_connected{telescope/0}=0`
- Counter: `alpaca_error_total{telescope/0}` increments
- Rotator and camera: Continue normally, no logs, no state change

**Cycle 3: Camera disconnects**
- Log: `DISCONNECTED: camera/0 not responding`
- Metric: `alpaca_device_connected{camera/0}=0`
- Counter: `alpaca_error_total{camera/0}` increments
- Rotator: Continues normally
- Telescope: Remains disconnected, error counter continues incrementing

**Cycle 4: Telescope reconnects**
- Log: `CONNECTED: telescope/0`
- Metric: `alpaca_device_connected{telescope/0}=1`
- Counter: `alpaca_success_total{telescope/0}` resumes, skip list reset
- Rotator: Continues normally
- Camera: Remains disconnected, error counter continues incrementing

**Key Validation:**
- Each device maintains its own independent state
- State transitions of one device don't affect others
- Error/success counters track correctly per device
- No cross-contamination of metrics or logs
